    /**
     * The class @c Math contains methods for performing basic
     * numeric operations such as the elementary exponential, logarithm,
     * square root, and trigonometric functions.
     *
     * <p>The quality of implementation specifications concern two
     * properties, accuracy of the returned result and monotonicity of the
     * method.  Accuracy of the floating-point @c Math methods is
     * measured in terms of @a ulps, units in the last place.  For a
     * given floating-point format, an @a ulp of a
     * specific real number value is the distance between the two
     * floating-point values bracketing that numerical value.  When
     * discussing the accuracy of a method as a whole rather than at a
     * specific argument, the number of ulps cited is for the worst-case
     * error at any argument.  If a method always has an error less than
     * 0.5 ulps, the method always returns the floating-point number
     * nearest the exact result; such a method is @a correctly @a rounded.
     * A correctly rounded method is generally the best a
     * floating-point approximation can be; however, it is impractical for
     * many floating-point methods to be correctly rounded.  Instead, for
     * the @c Math class, a larger error bound of 1 or 2 ulps is
     * allowed for certain methods.  Informally, with a 1 ulp error bound,
     * when the exact result is a representable number, the exact result
     * should be returned as the computed result; otherwise, either of the
     * two floating-point values which bracket the exact result may be
     * returned.  For exact results large in magnitude, one of the
     * endpoints of the bracket may be infinite.  Besides accuracy at
     * individual arguments, maintaining proper relations between the
     * method at different arguments is also important.  Therefore, most
     * methods with more than 0.5 ulp errors are required to be
     * @a semi-monotonic: whenever the mathematical function is
     * non-decreasing, so is the floating-point approximation, likewise,
     * whenever the mathematical function is non-increasing, so is the
     * floating-point approximation.  Not all approximations that have 1
     * ulp accuracy will automatically meet the monotonicity requirements.
     *
     * <p>
     * The platform uses signed two's complement integer arithmetic with
     * gint and glong primitive types.  The developer should choose
     * the primitive type to ensure that arithmetic operations consistently
     * produce correct results, which in some cases means the operations
     * will not overflow the range of values of the computation.
     * The best practice is to choose the primitive type and algorithm to avoid
     * overflow. In cases where the size is @c gint or @c glong and
     * overflow errors need to be detected, the methods whose names end with
     * @c Exact throw an @c ArithmeticException when the results overflow.
     *
     * <h2><a >IEEE 754 Recommended Operations</a></h2>
     *
     * The 2019 revision of the IEEE 754 floating-point standard includes
     * a section of recommended operations and the semantics of those
     * operations if they are included in a programming environment. The
     * recommended operations present in this class include @a sin,
     * @a cos, @a tan, @a asin, @a acos,
     * @a atan, @a exp, @a expm1,
     * @a log, @a log10, @a log1p,
     * @a sinh, @a cosh, @a tanh,
     * @a hypot, and @a pow.  (The @a sqrt
     * operation is a required part of IEEE 754 from a different section
     * of the standard.) The special case behavior of the recommended
     * operations generally follows the guidance of the IEEE 754
     * standard. However, the @c pow method defines different
     * behavior for some arguments, as noted in its @a pow
     * specification. The IEEE 754 standard defines its operations to be
     * correctly rounded, which is a more stringent quality of
     * implementation condition than required for most of the methods in
     * question that are also included in this class.
     *
