    /**
     * The @c Double class wraps a value of the primitive type
     * @c double in an object. An object of type
     * @c Double contains a single field whose type is
     * @c double.
     *
     * <h2>Floating-point Equality, Equivalence, and Comparison</h2>
     *
     * IEEE 754 floating-point values include finite nonzero values,
     * signed zeros (@c +0.0 and @c -0.0), signed infinities
     * (@a positive infinity and @a negative infinity), and
     * @a NaN (not-a-number).
     *
     * <p>An <em>equivalence relation</em> on a set of values is a boolean
     * relation on pairs of values that is reflexive, symmetric, and
     * transitive. For more discussion of equivalence relations and object
     * equality, see the @c Object#equals Object.equals
     * specification. An equivalence relation partitions the values it
     * operates over into sets called <i>equivalence classes</i>.  All the
     * members of the equivalence class are equal to each other under the
     * relation. An equivalence class may contain only a single member. At
     * least for some purposes, all the members of an equivalence class
     * are substitutable for each other.  In particular, in a numeric
     * expression equivalent values can be <em>substituted</em> for one
     * another without changing the result of the expression, meaning
     * changing the equivalence class of the result of the expression.
     *
     * <p>Notably, the built-in @c == operation on floating-point
     * values is <em>not</em> an equivalence relation. Despite not
     * defining an equivalence relation, the semantics of the IEEE 754
     * @c == operator were deliberately designed to meet other needs
     * of numerical computation. There are two exceptions where the
     * properties of an equivalence relation are not satisfied by @c
     * == on floating-point values:
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>If @c v1 and @c v2 are both NaN, then @c v1
     * == v2 has the value @c false. Therefore, for two NaN
     * arguments the <em>reflexive</em> property of an equivalence
     * relation is <em>not</em> satisfied by the @c == operator.
     *
     * <li>If @c v1 represents @c +0.0 while @c v2
     * represents @c -0.0, or vice versa, then @c v1 == v2 has
     * the value @c true even though @c +0.0 and @c -0.0
     * are distinguishable under various floating-point operations. For
     * example, @c 1.0/+0.0 evaluates to positive infinity while
     * @c 1.0/-0.0 evaluates to <em>negative</em> infinity and
     * positive infinity and negative infinity are neither equal to each
     * other nor equivalent to each other. Thus, while a signed zero input
     * most commonly determines the sign of a zero result, because of
     * dividing by zero, @c +0.0 and @c -0.0 may not be
     * substituted for each other in general. The sign of a zero input
     * also has a non-substitutable effect on the result of some math
     * library methods.
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>For ordered comparisons using the built-in comparison operators
     * (@c <, @c <=, etc.), NaN values have another anomalous
     * situation: a NaN is neither less than, nor greater than, nor equal
     * to any value, including itself. This means the <i>trichotomy of
     * comparison</i> does <em>not</em> hold.
     *
     * <p>To provide the appropriate semantics for @c equals and
     * @c compareTo methods, those methods cannot simply be wrappers
     * around @c == or ordered comparison operations. Instead, @c equals uses
     * <a> representation equivalence</a>, defining NaN arguments to be equal to each other,
     * restoring reflexivity, and defining @c +0.0 to <em>not</em> be
     * equal to @c -0.0. For comparisons, @c compareTo defines a total order where @c -0.0
     * is less than @c +0.0 and where a NaN is equal to itself and considered
     * greater than positive infinity.
     *
     * <p>The operational semantics of @c equals and @c
     * compareTo are expressed in terms of @c bit-wise converting the floating-point values to integral values.
     *
     * <p>The <em>natural ordering</em> implemented by @c Double::compareTo
     * compareTo is @c Comparable consistent with equals. That
     * is, two objects are reported as equal by @c equals if and only
     * if @c compareTo on those objects returns zero.
     *
     * <p>The adjusted behaviors defined for @c equals and @c
     * compareTo allow instances of wrapper classes to work properly with
     * conventional data structures. For example, defining NaN
     * values to be @c equals to one another allows NaN to be used as
     * an element of a @c java.util.HashSet HashSet or as the key of
     * a @c java.util.HashMap HashMap. Similarly, defining @c
     * compareTo as a total ordering, including @c +0.0, @c
     * -0.0, and NaN, allows instances of wrapper classes to be used as
     * elements of a @c java.util.SortedSet SortedSet or as keys of a
     * @c SortedMap.
     *
     * <p>Comparing numerical equality to various useful equivalence
     * relations that can be defined over floating-point values:
     *
     * <dl>
     * <dt><a id=fpNumericalEq><i>numerical equality</i></a> (@c ==
     * operator): (<em>Not</em> an equivalence relation)</dt>
     * <dd>Two floating-point values represent the same extended real
     * number. The extended real numbers are the real numbers augmented
     * with positive infinity and negative infinity. Under numerical
     * equality, @c +0.0 and @c -0.0 are equal since they both
     * map to the same real value, 0. A NaN does not map to any real
     * number and is not equal to any value, including itself.
     * </dd>
     *
     * <dt><i>bit-wise equivalence</i>:</dt>
     * <dd>The bits of the two floating-point values are the same. This
     * equivalence relation for @c double values @c a and @c
     * b is implemented by the expression
     * <br>@c Double::doubleTo<code>@c Raw</code>@c LongBits(a) == Double::doubleTo<code>@c Raw</code>@c LongBits(b)<br>
     * Under this relation, @c +0.0 and @c -0.0 are
     * distinguished from each other and every bit pattern encoding a NaN
     * is distinguished from every other bit pattern encoding a NaN.
     * </dd>
     *
     * <dt><i><a id=repEquivalence>representation equivalence</a></i>:</dt>
     * <dd>The two floating-point values represent the same IEEE 754
     * <i>datum</i>. In particular, for @c finite values,
     * the sign, @c exponent, and significand components of the floating-point values
     * are the same. Under this relation:
     * <ul>
     * <li> @c +0.0 and @c -0.0 are distinguished from each other.
     * <li> every bit pattern encoding a NaN is considered equivalent to each other
     * <li> positive infinity is equivalent to positive infinity; negative
     *      infinity is equivalent to negative infinity.
     * </ul>
     * Expressions implementing this equivalence relation include:
     * <ul>
     * <li>@c Double::doubleToLongBits(a) == Double::doubleToLongBits(b)
     * <li>@c Double::valueOf(a).equals(Double::valueOf(b))
     * <li>@c Double::compare(a, b) == 0
     * </ul>
     * Note that representation equivalence is often an appropriate notion
     * of equivalence to test the behavior of @c StrictMath math
     * libraries.
     * </dd>
     * </dl>
     *
     * For two binary floating-point values @c a and @c b, if
     * neither of @c a and @c b is zero or NaN, then the three
     * relations numerical equality, bit-wise equivalence, and
     * representation equivalence of @c a and @c b have the same
     * @c true/@c false value. In other words, for binary
     * floating-point values, the three relations only differ if at least
     * one argument is zero or NaN.

         * according to the usual <em>round to nearest</em> rounding policy of

         * value.

         * than or equal to @c Double::MIN_VALUE/2), rounding to float will
         * result in a zero.
         *
         * Finally, after rounding a @c Double object representing
         * this @c double value is returned.

         * <p> To interpret localized string representations of a
         * floating-point value, use subclasses of @c
         * java.text.NumberFormat.
         *
         * <p>Note that trailing format specifiers, specifiers that
         * determine the type of a floating-point literal
         * (@c 1.0f is a @c float value;
         * @c 1.0d is a @c double value), do
         * <em>not</em> influence the results of this method.  In other
         * words, the numerical value of the input string is converted
         * directly to the target floating-point type.  The two-step
         * sequence of conversions, string to @c float followed
         * by @c float to @c double, is <em>not</em>
         * equivalent to converting a string directly to
         * @c double. For example, the @c float
         * literal @c 0.1f is equal to the @c double
         * value @c 0.10000000149011612; the @c float
         * literal @c 0.1f represents a different numerical
         * value than the @c double literal
         * @c 0.1. (The numerical value 0.1 cannot be exactly
         * represented in a binary floating-point number.)
         *
