    /**
     * A mutable sequence of characters.  This class provides an API compatible
     * with @c SyncXString, but with no guarantee of synchronization.
     * This class is designed for use as a drop-in replacement for
     * @c SyncString in places where the string buffer was being
     * used by a single thread (as is generally the case).   Where possible,
     * it is recommended that this class be used in preference to
     * @c SyncXString as it will be faster under most implementations.
     *
     * <p>The principal operations on a @c XString are the
     * @c append and @c insert methods, which are
     * overloaded so as to accept data of any type. Each effectively
     * converts a given datum to a string and then appends or inserts the
     * characters of that string to the string builder. The
     * @c append method always adds these characters at the end
     * of the builder; the @c insert method adds the characters at
     * a specified point.
     * <p>
     * For example, if @c z refers to a string builder object
     * whose current contents are "@c start", then
     * the method call @c z.append("le") would cause the string
     * builder to contain "@c startle", whereas
     * @c z.insert(4, "le") would alter the string builder to
     * contain "@c starlet".
     * <p>
     * In general, if sb refers to an instance of a @c XString,
     * then @c sb.append(x) has the same effect as
     * @c sb.insert(sb.length(), x).
     * <p>
     * Every string builder has a capacity. As glong as the length of the
     * character sequence contained in the string builder does not exceed
     * the capacity, it is not necessary to allocate a new internal
     * buffer. If the internal buffer overflows, it is automatically made larger.
     *
     * <p>Instances of @c XString are not safe for
     * use by multiple threads. If such synchronization is required then it is
     * recommended that @c SyncString be used.
     *
     * @note @c XString implements @c Comparable but does not override
     * @c equals. Thus, the natural ordering of @c XString
     * is inconsistent with equals. Care should be exercised if @c XString
     * objects are used as keys in a @c SortedMap or elements in a @c SortedSet.
     * See @c Comparable, @c SortedMap, or
     * @c SortedSet for more information.
