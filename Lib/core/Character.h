     * The @c Character class wraps a value of the primitive
     * type @c gchar in an object. An object of class
     * @c Character contains a single field whose type is @c gchar.
     * <p>
     * In addition, this class provides a large number of static methods for
     * determining a character's category (lowercase letter, digit, etc.)
     * and for converting characters from uppercase to lowercase and vice
     * versa.
     *
     * <h2><a id="conformance">Unicode Conformance</a></h2>
     * <p>
     * The fields and methods of class @c Character are defined in terms
     * of character information from the Unicode Standard, specifically the
     * <i>UnicodeData</i> file that is part of the Unicode Character Database.
     * This file specifies properties including name and category for every
     * assigned Unicode code point or character range. The file is available
     * from the Unicode Consortium at http://www.unicode.org.
     * <p>
     * Character information is based on the Unicode Standard, version 15.0.
     *
     * <h2>Unicode Character Representations</h2>
     *
     * <p>The @c gchar data type (and therefore the value that a
     * @c Character object encapsulates) are based on the
     * original Unicode specification, which defined characters as
     * fixed-width 16-bit entities. The Unicode Standard has since been
     * changed to allow for characters whose representation requires more
     * than 16 bits.  The range of legal @a code points is now
     * U+0000 to U+10FFFF, known as @a Unicode scalar value.
     * (Refer to the <a
     * href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr27/#notation">@a definition</a> of
     * the U+<i>n</i> notation in the Unicode Standard.)
     *
     * <p>The set of characters from U+0000 to U+FFFF is
     * sometimes referred to as the @a Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).
     * <a id="supplementary">Characters</a> whose code points are greater
     * than U+FFFF are called @a supplementary characters.  The Java
     * platform uses the UTF-16 representation in @c gchar arrays and
     * in the @c String and @c XString classes. In
     * this representation, supplementary characters are represented as a pair
     * of @c gchar values, the first from the @a high-surrogates
     * range, (\\uD800-\\uDBFF), the second from the
     * @a low-surrogates range (\\uDC00-\\uDFFF).
     *
     * <p>A @c gchar value, therefore, represents Basic
     * Multilingual Plane (BMP) code points, including the surrogate
     * code points, or code units of the UTF-16 encoding. An
     * @c gint value represents all Unicode code points,
     * including supplementary code points. The lower (least significant)
     * 21 bits of @c gint are used to represent Unicode code
     * points and the upper (most significant) 11 bits must be zero.
     * Unless otherwise specified, the behavior with respect to
     * supplementary characters and surrogate @c gchar values is
     * as follows:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>The methods that only accept a @c gchar value cannot support
     * supplementary characters. They treat @c gchar values from the
     * surrogate ranges as undefined characters. For example,
     * @c Character::isLetter('\\uD840') returns @c false, even though
     * this specific value if followed by any low-surrogate value in a string
     * would represent a letter.
     *
     * <li>The methods that accept an @c gint value support all
     * Unicode characters, including supplementary characters. For
     * example, @c Character::isLetter(0x2F81A) returns
     * @c true because the code point value represents a letter
     * (a CJK ideograph).
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>In the API documentation, @a Unicode code point is
     * used for character values in the range between U+0000 and U+10FFFF,
     * and @a Unicode code unit is used for 16-bit
     * @c gchar values that are code units of the @a UTF-16
     * encoding. For more information on Unicode terminology, refer to the
     * <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/">Unicode Glossary</a>.
