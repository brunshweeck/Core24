    /**
     * Port of the "Freely Distributable Math Library", version 5.3, from C.
     *
     * <p>The C version of fdlibm relied on the idiom of pointer aliasing
     * a 64-bit double floating-point value as a two-element array of
     * 32-bit integers and reading and writing the two halves of the
     * double independently. This coding pattern was problematic to C
     * optimizers and not directly expressible in Java. Therefore, rather
     * than a memory level overlay, if portions of a double need to be
     * operated on as integer values, the standard library methods for
     * bitwise floating-point to integer conversion,
     * Double.longBitsToDouble and Double.doubleToRawLongBits, are directly
     * or indirectly used.
     *
     * <p>The C version of fdlibm also took some pains to signal the
     * correct IEEE 754 exceptional conditions divide by zero, invalid,
     * overflow and underflow. For example, overflow would be signaled by
     * @c huge*huge where @c huge was a large constant that
     * would overflow when squared. Since IEEE floating-point exceptional
     * handling is not supported natively in the JVM, such coding patterns
     * have been omitted from this port. For example, rather than
     * @code return huge*huge @endcode, this port will use @code return Math::INF @endcode.
     *
     * <p>Various comparison and arithmetic operations in fdlibm could be
     * done either based on the integer view of a value or directly on the
     * floating-point representation. Which idiom is faster may depend on
     * platform specific factors. However, for code clarity if no other
     * reason, this port will favor expressing the semantics of those
     * operations in terms of floating-point operations when convenient to
     * do so.

         *   3. Scale back to obtain exp(x):
         *      From step 1, we have
         *         exp(x) = 2^k * exp(r)
         *
         * Special cases:

         *      exp(-INF) is 0, and
         *      for finite argument, only exp(0)=1 is exact.
         *
         * Accuracy:
         *      according to an error analysis, the error is always less than
         *      1 ulp (unit in the last place).
         *
